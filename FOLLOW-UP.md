# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
I added following libraries to the front end:
"prop-types" for validation of props
"bpk-component-button" for Backpack button component
"bpk-component-icon" for Backpack icon component
"bpk-component-link" Backpack link component

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

npm start


# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
Use Typescript to type check the whole application. Currently I used PropTypes for props validation but Typescript can be more helpful as the application grows.
Use Bootstrap for responsive design of the application.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
Writing UI components for displaying list of itineraries because it required considerations of how to manage state and props across components.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I spent the most time on styling of the application. I did not find that particularly difficult but that required more consideration than other parts.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
The test is fine overall. It checks skills for designing UI components, state management across components as well as styling. For me, the styling took more time than other parts. I think the documentation of Backpack components can be made more helpful.
